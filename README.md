## Introduction

This guide demonstrates how to build and deploy a **CAP (Cloud Application Programming Model) Java application** to **SAP BTP (Cloud Foundry runtime)**.  

It includes:
- üìö A simple data model (`Books`)  
- üõ† An OData V4 service (`CatalogService`)  
- üöÄ Deployment to BTP using `mta.yaml` and `mbt`  

---

## Setting Up Development Environment

Install the required tools:

```bash
# CAP CLI
npm install -g @sap/cds-dk

# Java 17+
java -version

# Maven
mvn -version

# MBT Build Tool
npm install -g mbt

# Cloud Foundry CLI
cf --version
````

---

## Project Structure

Create a new CAP Java project:

```bash
mkdir my-cap-app
cd my-cap-app
cds init --add java
```

Generated structure:

```
my-cap-app/
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db/
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ srv/
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mta.yaml
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pom.xml
```

---

## Data Model

Define **db/schema.cds**:

```cds
namespace my.bookshop;

entity Books {
  key ID   : Integer;
  title    : String;
  author   : String;
  stock    : Integer;
}
```

---

## Service Definition

Create **srv/cat-service.cds**:

```cds
using my.bookshop as my from '../db/schema';

service CatalogService {
  entity Books as projection on my.Books;
}
```

---

## Running Locally

Run the CAP service:

```bash
cds watch
```

Access [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004) to test OData endpoints.

---

## Testing with Postman

* **GET Books**

  ```
  GET http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/CatalogService/Books
  ```

* **POST Book**

  ```
  POST http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/CatalogService/Books
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "ID": 1,
    "title": "Clean Code",
    "author": "Robert C. Martin",
    "stock": 50
  }
  ```

---

## MTA Configuration

Define **mta.yaml**:

```yaml
ID: my-cap-app
_version: 1.0.0
version: 1.0.0

modules:
  - name: my-bookshop-srv
    type: java
    path: srv
    parameters:
      memory: 1024M
    requires:
      - name: my-cap-app-db

resources:
  - name: my-cap-app-db
    type: com.sap.xs.hdi-container
    parameters:
      service: hana
      service-plan: hdi-shared
```

---

## Building the Project

```bash
mvn clean install
```

---

## Building MTA Archive

```bash
mbt build -p cf -t mta_archives
```

This generates:

```
mta_archives/my-cap-app_1.0.0.mtar
```

---

## Deploying to BTP

Push the MTA archive:

```bash
cf deploy mta_archives/my-cap-app_1.0.0.mtar
```

---

## Accessing the Service

After deployment:

```bash
cf apps
```

Open the app URL in the browser:

```
/odata/v4/CatalogService/Books
```

---

Thanks for sharing this build log üôè ‚Äì this explains a lot.

The important line is:

```
[INFO] GenerateMojo: No csn file found, skipping execution.
```

‚ö†Ô∏è That means the **CDS model (CSN file)** is missing ‚Üí so the `cds-maven-plugin` cannot generate Java classes from your schema.

---

## üîç Why is CSN missing?

* In **CAP Java**, the `.cds` files must be in the correct folder structure:

  ```
  srv/src/main/resources/db/schema.cds
  srv/src/main/resources/srv/cat-service.cds
  ```

  or in the project root `db/` and `srv/` if using **CAP Node.js**.

* The plugin expects to find them under `src/main/resources/`. If they are only in `/db/schema.cds` at root, they won‚Äôt be picked up.

---

## ‚úÖ Fix

1. Move your CDS files:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p srv/src/main/resources/db
   mkdir -p srv/src/main/resources/srv
   mv db/schema.cds srv/src/main/resources/db/
   mv srv/cat-service.cds srv/src/main/resources/srv/
   ```

2. Clean & rebuild:

   ```sh
   mvn clean package
   ```

   Now the plugin should generate Java sources under:

   ```
   srv/src/gen/java/
   ```

3. If you want to check generation separately:

   ```sh
   mvn com.sap.cds:cds-maven-plugin:generate
   ```

   You should no longer see **‚ÄúNo csn file found‚Äù**.

---

## üöÄ After Fix

* Build works ‚Üí `.jar` is created in `srv/target/`
* You can then build your MTAR:

  ```sh
  mbt build -p cf -t mta_archives
  cf deploy mta_archives/my-cap-app_1.0.0.mtar
  ```

---

üëâ Do you want me to also give you a **ready-to-use `mta.yaml`** for this CAP Java bookstore app (with DB + service), so you can deploy without tweaking?


## Conclusion

üéâ You have successfully:

* Built a **CAP Java backend**
* Exposed it via **OData V4 service**
* Deployed to **SAP BTP Cloud Foundry runtime**

You can now extend the app with more entities, services, and authentication!



Do you want me to also **add diagrams (architecture + deployment flow) in Markdown** like ASCII or Mermaid for GitHub rendering?
